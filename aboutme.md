My name is Chris Carrington. I'm a Seattle based software engineer with over ten years of computing/IT experience, five years of technical support experience, and more than five years of software development experience. I'm also a fast learner, with a talent for learning through experimentation.

After a 5-year career break, I'm getting back into the workforce. While searching for work, I have spent most of my recent time writing some open-source code. Please take a look at my projects.

I’m always looking for new projects and partners to collaborate with, so get in touch if you’d like to connect.
